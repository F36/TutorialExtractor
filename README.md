# Tutorials Extractor

This project was built on an asfterthought to accumulate the various pages of an online tutorial blog into one for easy and offline access.

Thereby I used general standards, semantics and certain Weird Specifications to put up a Web App that accepts tutorial URLs, a chain of pages to scour and scrape through and finally accumulate it if possible by PDFKit through wkhtmltopdf. 

It has been specially optimized for [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) (since it has clearest syntax to soup) and works great with [JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/) and can work for any generic Tutorial even if Sub Optimally.
